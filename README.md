# airbnb-clone-project

## About the Project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Team Roles
* Business Analyst (BA): Translates business needs into clear technical requirements.

* Product Owner (PO): Defines and owns the product vision to ensure it meets customer needs.

* Project Manager (PM): Ensures the project is delivered on time, within scope, and on budget.

* UI/UX Designer: Designs intuitive and effective user experiences and interfaces.

* Software Architect: Designs the system‚Äôs high-level structure and technology stack.

* Software Developer: Writes and maintains the code that powers the application.

* Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Tests the product to ensure it meets quality standards.

* Test Automation Engineer: Builds scripts to automate and accelerate product testing.

* DevOps Engineer: Automates deployment and integrates development with operations for fast, stable releases.


## Technology Stack

Django: Builds the backend and API.

Django REST Framework: Helps create and manage the API.

PostgreSQL: Stores the app‚Äôs data.

GraphQL: Lets you fetch only the data you need.

Celery: Runs background tasks (e.g., emails, payments).

Redis: Speeds things up with caching and stores sessions.

Docker: Packages the app for easy setup and deployment.

CI/CD Pipelines: Automatically tests and deploys updates.



## Database Design





## Feature Breakdown

1. API Documentation
The backend uses the OpenAPI standard to document APIs, making them easy to understand and integrate. Django REST Framework and GraphQL provide both RESTful and flexible query interfaces, allowing developers to interact with backend data efficiently.

2. User Authentication
APIs like /users/ enable user registration, login, and profile management. This ensures secure access and personalized experiences for each user.

3. Property Management
Endpoints such as /properties/ let users create, update, view, and delete property listings. It powers the core business logic for managing real estate assets on the platform.

4. Booking System
The booking API (/bookings/) handles all reservation logic including check-ins and check-outs. This enables seamless management of property availability and guest scheduling.

5. Payment Processing
The /payments/ endpoint processes payments tied to bookings. It ensures secure financial transactions and keeps track of revenue.

6. Review System
Through /reviews/, users can share feedback on properties. This adds trust, improves transparency, and influences future bookings.

7. Database Optimizations
Performance tuning strategies like indexing, query optimization, and caching are implemented. These ensure the system runs efficiently even with large data volumes.


## API Security

üîê Key Security Measures and Their Importance
1. Authentication
Secure login systems (e.g., token-based authentication) will verify user identities before granting access.
‚û°Ô∏è Why it matters: Protects user accounts and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data.

2. Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will ensure users can only perform actions allowed for their role.
‚û°Ô∏è Why it matters: Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they shouldn‚Äôt (e.g., non-admins editing bookings).

3. Rate Limiting
Limits the number of requests a user or IP can make in a given time period.
‚û°Ô∏è Why it matters: Helps protect the API from abuse, brute-force attacks, and server overload.

4. Data Encryption (at rest & in transit)
All sensitive data will be encrypted using HTTPS (TLS) and secure database practices.
‚û°Ô∏è Why it matters: Safeguards user credentials, personal data, and financial information from interception or leaks.

5. Secure Payment Handling
Use of trusted third-party payment gateways with PCI-DSS compliance.
‚û°Ô∏è Why it matters: Protects transaction details and reduces liability for handling sensitive payment data directly.

6. Input Validation & Sanitization
All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
‚û°Ô∏è Why it matters: Defends against common threats like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).



## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD automates testing and deployment, ensuring fast, reliable updates without breaking the app.
Why important: Speeds up development, maintains quality, and reduces errors.
Tools: GitHub Actions, Docker, Heroku, Render, AWS.
